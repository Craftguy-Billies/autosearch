# üÜì Deploy WITHOUT Credit Card - Complete Guide

All these options are **100% FREE** and require **NO CREDIT CARD**!

---

## Option 1: Vercel ‚≠ê (Recommended - 30 Seconds Setup)

**Why Vercel:**
- ‚úÖ No credit card required
- ‚úÖ Instant deployment
- ‚úÖ Generous free tier
- ‚úÖ Different IP per request (less blocking)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 10-second timeout (code optimized for this)

### Deploy to Vercel:

```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Deploy
cd /Users/billiez/search_web
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# - Login with GitHub (no card needed!)
# - Project name: autosearch
# - Deploy: Yes
```

**That's it!** Your URL: `https://autosearch.vercel.app`

### Test it:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
# Update test_api.py with new URL
python test_api.py
```

## Option 2: Keep Using Replit (Already Works!)

Your Replit is live at:
`https://323b2ed7-b05f-4f72-a1cf-100a54adc7a3-00-ijp4vpyqd8ks.pike.replit.dev`

**The search issue might be fixable!** Let's debug:

### Update Replit Code:

In your Replit shell:
```bash
git pull
# Click "Run" button again
```

This pulls the latest debug code to see what's happening.

### Check Logs:
Watch for `[DEBUG]` messages to see if it's actually being blocked or if it's a parsing issue.

## Option 3: Glitch (Like Replit, No Card)

**100% Free, runs 24/7 if you ping it**

1. Go to: https://glitch.com
2. Click **"New Project"** ‚Üí **"Import from GitHub"**
3. Paste: `https://github.com/Craftguy-Billies/autosearch`
4. Wait for import (2 minutes)
5. It automatically runs!

Your URL: `https://autosearch.glitch.me`

**Keep it awake:** Glitch sleeps after 5 min. Use UptimeRobot (free) to ping it.

---

## Option 4: Railway ($5 Free Credit, No Card Initially)

**Update:** Railway now gives $5 free credit without a card!

```bash
# Install CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login with GitHub (no card!)
railway login

# Deploy
cd /Users/billiez/search_web
railway init
railway up
```

You get $5 credit = ~500 hours = plenty for testing!

---

## Option 5: Netlify (Serverless, No Card)

**Free tier, but needs conversion to serverless functions**

```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify login
netlify deploy
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Requires some code changes (I can do this if needed)

---

## Comparison: Which to Choose?

| Platform | Setup Time | Effort | Best For |
|----------|------------|--------|----------|
| **Vercel** ‚≠ê | 30 seconds | Easy | Quick testing |
| **Replit** | Already done | None | Already working |
| **Glitch** | 2 minutes | Easy | 24/7 uptime |
| **Railway** | 2 minutes | Easy | $5 credit |
| **Netlify** | 5 minutes | Medium | If others fail |

---

## üéØ My Recommendation:

### Try This Order:

1. **Vercel** (30 seconds) - Let's do it now!
2. **Debug Replit** - It might work fine
3. **Glitch** - If you want 24/7 free hosting

---

## Let's Deploy to Vercel Right Now!

I've already created `vercel.json` and optimized the code. Just run:

```bash
cd /Users/billiez/search_web

# Commit the changes
git add -A
git commit -m "Add Vercel support"
git push

# Deploy
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

When it asks:
- "Set up and deploy?" ‚Üí **Yes**
- "Which scope?" ‚Üí Choose your account
- "Link to existing project?" ‚Üí **No**
- "Project name?" ‚Üí **autosearch** (or your choice)
- "In which directory is your code?" ‚Üí **.** (current)
- "Want to override settings?" ‚Üí **No**

**Done!** You'll get a URL immediately.

## Or: Let's Debug Replit

Your Replit might actually work! The issue could be:
1. Code not updated (needs `git pull`)
2. DuckDuckGo HTML structure changed (fixable)
3. Actual IP blocking (then try Vercel)

**Want me to help debug Replit first?** Or shall we deploy to Vercel?

Let me know! üöÄ
