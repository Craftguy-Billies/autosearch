# üêõ Debugging Guide

## Current Issue
The API is returning "No relevant information found" too quickly (~1 second), which means the search engines aren't returning results.

## Step 1: Update Replit with Latest Code

### In your Replit console (Shell tab):
```bash
git pull
```

Then click the **"Run"** button again to restart the server.

## Step 2: Watch the Debug Logs

In the Replit console, you should now see detailed debug logs like:

```
[DEBUG] === Smart Search Starting ===
[DEBUG] Query: "Python programming"
[DEBUG] Max Results: 5
[DEBUG] Attempting DuckDuckGo search...
[DEBUG] DuckDuckGo URL: https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/?q=Python+programming
[DEBUG] Response status: 200, Content length: XXXXX
[DEBUG] Total <tr> elements: XX
[DEBUG] Total <a> elements: XX
```

## Step 3: Test Again

Run this from your local machine:
```bash
cd /Users/billiez/search_web
source venv/bin/activate
python debug_test.py
```

## What to Look For in Replit Logs:

### ‚úÖ Good Signs:
- `[DEBUG] ‚úÖ DuckDuckGo returned X results`
- `[DEBUG] Found result: ...`
- Processing time > 10 seconds (means it's actually scraping)

### ‚ùå Problem Signs:

**If you see:**
```
[DEBUG] DuckDuckGo search error: ...
```
‚Üí **Replit is being blocked by DuckDuckGo** (rate limiting or IP blocking)

**If you see:**
```
[DEBUG] Total <a> elements: 0
```
‚Üí **DuckDuckGo changed their HTML structure**

**If you see:**
```
[DEBUG] Bing also failed
```
‚Üí **Both search engines are blocking Replit's IP**

## Solutions for Each Issue:

### Solution 1: If Search Engines Are Blocking Replit

DuckDuckGo and Bing may block cloud hosting IPs. We have a few options:

#### Option A: Use SerpAPI (Recommended for Production)
Sign up for free API key at https://serpapi.com (100 free searches/month)

#### Option B: Use Alternative Search Engines
- Try Brave Search API (free tier available)
- Try Google Custom Search API

#### Option C: Use SOCKS5 Proxy
Add proxy support to bypass IP blocks

### Solution 2: If HTML Structure Changed

We can update the parsers to match the new HTML structure.

## Quick Test: Verify Search Engines Work from Replit

In Replit shell, run:
```bash
curl -A "Mozilla/5.0" "https://lite.duckduckgo.com/lite/?q=test" | head -100
```

If you see HTML content with search results ‚Üí Parsing issue
If you see error/blocked page ‚Üí IP blocking issue

## Alternative: Test Locally First

Let's verify it works locally before Replit:

```bash
# Kill any running local server
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null

# Start server locally
cd /Users/billiez/search_web
node server.js
```

Then in another terminal:
```bash
cd /Users/billiez/search_web
source venv/bin/activate
python test_live.py
```

If it works locally but not on Replit ‚Üí **IP blocking issue**
If it doesn't work locally either ‚Üí **HTML parsing issue**

## Most Likely Issue

Based on the fast response time (1.03s), I suspect:
1. **Replit hasn't pulled the new code yet** (most likely)
2. **Replit's IP is being blocked by search engines**

Try updating the code in Replit first (Step 1 above) and check the logs!
